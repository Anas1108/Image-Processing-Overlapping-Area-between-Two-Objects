# Image Processing - Overlapping Area between Two Objects

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of finding the overlapping area between two objects using OpenCV.

## Method

The implementation uses OpenCV functions to detect and extract the contours of both objects and calculates the overlapping area using the `cv2.bitwise_and` function.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you need to provide two input images of the objects and run the code. The code will output the overlapping area between the two objects as an image.

## Conclusion

The implementation in this repository provides a basic method for finding the overlapping area between two objects in an image. It can be further modified or extended for different applications and use cases.
